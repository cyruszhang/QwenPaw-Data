# qwenpaw-data-host-core

Shared host foundation for QwenPaw Data.

This package owns the non-HTTP QwenPaw Data host runtime:

- `QwenPawDataHost` runtime handle for `plan`, `execute`, and `run`
- AgentScope agent, toolkit, workspace tools, and prompt templates
- DAG orchestration, session trace storage, and artifact path helpers
- MCP Context Manager timeout and metadata injection helpers
- Context Manager HTTP discovery client used by CLI integrations

Concrete host packages such as `qwenpaw-data-cli` should depend on this package instead of duplicating host orchestration logic.

## Headless service (optional `[service]` extra)

The engine can run as a headless service that any frontend (PawApp, CLI,
third parties) consumes over HTTP + SSE:

```bash
pip install "qwenpaw-data-host-core[service]" uvicorn
QWENPAW_DATA_API_TOKEN=<token> \
uvicorn --factory 'qwenpaw_data.host.core.api.app:create_app' --workers 1
```

The service is single-process (in-process event fan-out); always run one
worker. Without `QWENPAW_DATA_API_TOKEN`, only loopback clients are accepted.

### API surface (`/api/v1`)

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /sessions` · `GET /sessions` · `GET/PATCH/DELETE /sessions/{id}` | Session lifecycle: create, list (search/filter/sort/pagination), rename, soft-delete |
| `POST /sessions/{sid}/chats` | Start a turn in an existing session: `{"text": ..., "datasource_id": ...}` → `{"chat": {...}}`; 404 without a session, 409 while a turn is active |
| `GET /capabilities/submissions` | Discover durable submission protocol support (SQL only) |
| `POST /submissions` · `GET /submissions/{id}` | Atomically create an independent session/run with an idempotent submission ID; query its original identity and status |
| `POST /submissions/{id}/commands` · `GET /submissions/{id}/commands/{command_id}` | Durably answer the run's active clarification or cancel the original run; retry and reconcile by command ID |
| `GET /submissions/{id}/events` | Replay and follow the accepted run's persisted events with the same SSE cursor contract |
| `GET /sessions/{sid}/chats` | List a session's chats |
| `POST /sessions/{sid}/chats/{cid}/stop` | Cancel a running turn |
| `GET /sessions/{sid}/chats/{cid}/events` | SSE stream: replays persisted history, then live events; supports `Last-Event-ID` (or `after_sequence_number`) resume |
| `POST /sessions/{sid}/chats/{cid}/steer` | Inject steering text into the running turn (204; 409 when not active) |
| `POST /sessions/{sid}/chats/{cid}/clarification/answer` | Deliver an `ask_user_question` result to the paused turn |
| `GET/PUT/DELETE /preferences/providers[/{id}]` · `.../models/{id}` · `GET/PUT /preferences/active-models` | Model provider credentials (masked in responses), model overrides, active model selection |
| `GET /datasources` | DataBridge datasource discovery proxied through the service |
| `GET/POST /cron/jobs` · `GET/PUT/DELETE /cron/jobs/{id}` · `POST .../pause|resume|run` | Scheduled agent runs: a cron expression or one-shot time opens a console chat with the configured message/datasource (single-process APScheduler) |

### Storage backends

The service persists sessions/chats/events/preferences through a store
protocol with two interchangeable backends:

- **sqlite (default)**: `<home>/host/host.db` (WAL); point
  `QWENPAW_DATA_DB_URL` at another SQLAlchemy async URL (e.g. postgres).
- **JSON files**: set `QWENPAW_DATA_STORE=json` for the zero-dependency
  file layout (`<home>/host/{chats,sessions,preferences}/`).

A conformance test suite runs every store test against both backends.
Durable submissions require SQL; JSON mode explicitly returns 501 for this
protocol. See the [submission contract](../../../docs/design/pawapp-submission-protocol.md)
for retry, recovery, authentication, and compatibility requirements.
When no explicit model is passed, the service resolves the local user's
configured active model from preferences and falls back to env vars.

### SSE stream objects

Each SSE frame carries `id` (dense per-chat sequence number), `event`
(object type), and a JSON body discriminated on `object`:

`response` (created/in_progress/completed/failed/cancelled, terminal frames
close the stream) · `message` / `content` (assistant text, reasoning, tool
calls and outputs, media) · `task_status` (DAG plan snapshots) ·
`biz_event` / `segment` / `artifact.registered` / `followup.generated`
(structured execution metadata). Artifact registrations include media type,
size, and SHA-256 digest. Digest-bound artifact reads verify session ownership
and reject content that changed after registration.

### Environment variables

- `QWENPAW_DATA_API_TOKEN` — bearer token; unset = loopback-only
- `QWENPAW_DATA_STORE` — `json` to use file-backed stores (default: sqlite)
- `QWENPAW_DATA_DB_URL` — SQLAlchemy async URL (default `sqlite+aiosqlite:///<home>/host/host.db`)
- `QWENPAW_DATA_PREFS_MASTER_SECRET` — hex secret (≥32 bytes) to encrypt stored provider API keys at rest
- `QWENPAW_DATA_CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` — comma-separated origins (default loopback)
- `QWENPAW_DATA_STREAM_SSE_HEARTBEAT_SECONDS` — keepalive interval (default 15)
- `QWENPAW_DATA_FOLLOWUP_ENABLED` — `0` disables follow-up question recommendation (default on)
- `QWENPAW_DATA_MODEL_PROVIDER` / `_NAME` / `_API_KEY` / `_BASE_URL` — model config fallback when no active model is set via preferences

Chat and event history persist in the selected backend, so SSE resume
works across service restarts; orphaned running chats are cancelled on
startup.

## Default local state

`qwenpaw-data-host-core` resolves its own local state through
`qwenpaw_data.host.core.paths`; it does not use DataBridge path helpers.

```text

            └── {graph_id}/{node_id}/      # optional TaskGraph node scope
```

Directories are created lazily by their writers. The Host does not read or
migrate the historical `${QWENPAW_DATA_HOME}/agents/default` layout.
