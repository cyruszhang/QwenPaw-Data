# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file. The format is
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and releases
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Durable Engine submissions for PawApp backends: atomic session/run creation,
  idempotent retries, lookup by submission ID, and replayable events. SQL startup
  recovery preserves accepted run identities and reports interrupted execution
  without automatically rerunning it. See the
  [submission protocol](docs/design/pawapp-submission-protocol.md); JSON mode
  explicitly declines this protocol.
- Durable submission commands let a PawApp backend answer the active
  clarification or cancel the original run with idempotent command receipts,
  scoped lookup, conflict detection, and explicit unknown recovery state.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- `qwenpaw-data-host-core` exposes clarification and cron scheduling as agent
  tools, letting a running analysis request user input and schedule follow-up
  jobs directly.

### Changed

- Reverted the experimental chat timeline artifact cards, which rendered broken
  deliverable previews.

### Fixed

- The chat timeline now references generated deliverables instead of dangling
  placeholders.
- Chat state persists before the terminal event is emitted, preventing a lost
  final message.
- Scheduled (cron) runs wait for an idle session before firing, avoiding
  overlapping executions.
- SQL artifact materialization failures are contained instead of aborting the
  whole turn.
- Silent successful commands return a real observation rather than an empty
  result.
- Sandbox artifact handling is aligned across execution backends.
- `qwenpaw-data-skills` guides reference the corrected tool name.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- A headless engine service with HTTP and replayable SSE APIs for sessions,
  chats, attachments, artifacts, files, scheduled runs, steering, feedback,
  trace views, snapshots, forks, and signed share links.
- End-of-turn follow-up recommendations with model generation, deterministic
  rule fallback, entity grounding, relevance ranking, and prior-question
  deduplication.
- Pluggable graph backends, universal datasource connectors, a datasource type
  registry, and MySQL-compatible, DuckDB, and SQLite integrations.
- BizTrace segments, SQL-result artifacts, and confirmed semantic-knowledge
  settlement for analytical runs.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** renamed the public `datapaw-*` distributions, Python namespaces,
  and CLI to the `qwenpaw-data-*` package line and `qwenpaw-data` command.
- **Breaking:** removed engine-owned IM channel delivery. Hosts now own delivery
  and consume the engine through its HTTP/SSE boundary.
- The four Python distributions now follow one coordinated `0.3.x` minor line;
  internal package dependencies require `>=0.3,<0.4`.

### Fixed

- Follow-up timeout fallback now emits deterministic recommendations before the
  terminal SSE response instead of attempting an unobservable late event.
- Semantic-config writes commit before returning, and renamed CORS allow-header
  configuration is honored.

### Security

- Hardened explorer subgraph search and global snapshot caching.
- Raised `pypdf`, `dbt-core`, and `sqlparse` constraints past published
  advisories.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- `datapaw-context` now ships bundled GAAP demo assets (`demo_semantic_config.xlsx`
  and `seed-postgres.sql`) so the docker-compose one-shot demo works without a
  local source checkout.

### Changed

- Relaxed `anyio` lower bound to `>=4.0` and raised `openai` upper bound to
  `<2.34` for compatibility with the QwenPaw main application, which pins
  `anyio<4.13.0` (QwenPaw#2632) and requires `openai>=2.0.0,<=2.33.0`.

### Fixed

- Aligned workspace package versions; `0.2.1`–`0.2.3` were published without
  matching workspace bumps and have been yanked on PyPI.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- `datapaw datasource` now covers the full lifecycle: `get`, `create`
  (with optional pre-save connection test), `update`, `delete`, and `test`,
  all with masked credential output.
- New `datapaw semantic` command group: table-driven CRUD for business
  domains, datasets, columns, dimensions, dataset-dimension bindings,
  metrics, and metric formulas; Excel workbook import; and weave-task
  management (`submit` with `--wait`, `list`, `kill`).
- `SemanticConfigClient` in `datapaw-host-core` for the authenticated
  `/api/semantic-config` REST surface with pagination validation and the
  unified error protocol.
- Deterministic semantic-CLI smoke test (`examples/semantic_smoke_test.py`)
  covering datasource lifecycle, workbook import, semantic CRUD with partial
  updates, batch deletion, and a real weave publish, wired into the CI smoke
  job.

### Fixed

- Semantic-config partial updates no longer erase omitted fields: the
  repository UPDATE statements previously overwrote every column, so a
  partial payload hit NOT NULL constraints (HTTP 500) or silently nulled
  stored values. All seven resource repositories now preserve fields that
  are not part of the request.
- `datapaw semantic weave submit --wait` now recognizes the upper-case
  terminal states reported by DataBridge (`SUCCESS`/`FAILED`/`KILLED`)
  instead of polling until timeout.
- Added the missing `get_dataset_columns` MCP tool and corrected the tool
  names advertised by the `bi-semantic-layer-guide` skill
  (`get_metric`, `get_dimension`, `list_dimensions_of_metric`,
  `get_dataset`), which previously led agents to call non-existent tools;
  a new alignment test keeps the skill guide and the MCP registry in sync
  (#19).
- The publish workflow's pinned twine is now 7.0.0 so metadata checks accept
  the Metadata-Version 2.5 wheels produced by current hatchling.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- Dependabot configuration covering the Python (uv) workspace, the frontend
  npm workspace, and GitHub Actions.
- Persistent SQLite job storage with idempotency keys, leases, retries, expiry,
  and restart recovery.
- Request-level resource budgets and stable machine-readable API error codes.
- Docker-first workspace isolation, path containment, and process-group cleanup.
- Release, compatibility, public-history, SBOM, and integration-test tooling.
- Public package metadata, community templates, support policy, and a PyPI
  Trusted Publishing workflow.
- Executable SQLite/PostgreSQL demo data, expanded `datapaw doctor` diagnostics,
  and a deterministic real-CLI/DataBridge/SQL smoke test.
- Native Windows lifecycle and deterministic demo entry points, PowerShell
  workspace execution, cross-process session locking, and a Windows CI gate
  that exercises real initialization and DataBridge startup.

### Changed

- Locked development and CI validation to AgentScope 2.0.6, which the
  published `>=2.0.5,<2.1` range already resolves for end users.
- Services bind to loopback by default and use real scoped bearer-key checks.
- CORS and outbound callbacks require explicit allowlists.
- Import contracts now live in a transport-neutral application layer.
- Frontend routes are split into lazy chunks and hook lint is warning-free.
- The frontend baseline is now Node.js 22.22+, React 19, React Router 8, and
  Vite 7.

### Fixed

- Windows console-safe liveness probes, forced UTF-8 I/O on the native
  Windows CI job, and the ten test failures unmasked by the console fix.
- Synced the `datapaw-context` requirements lockfile with its `pyproject.toml`
  and made it universal.

### Security

- Raised the pypdf minimum to 6.15.0 to address CVE-2026-71852 and
  CVE-2026-71870.
- Removed unsafe development forwarding/process endpoints and internal assets.
- Added upload, query, response, callback, authentication, and rate limits.
- Added dependency, secret, license, CodeQL, and SBOM CI gates.
- Upgraded PostCSS to 8.5.26 to address GHSA-r28c-9q8g-f849 and
  GHSA-fxqj-rqcc-2cmp, upgraded pytest to 9.1.1 to address
  GHSA-6w46-j5rx-g56g, and extended CI auditing to development dependencies.
- Raised the MCP Python SDK minimum to 1.28.1 across all install paths to
  address CVE-2026-52869, CVE-2026-52870, and CVE-2026-59950.
- Raised the python-dotenv, Requests, and Vite minimums to the locked patched
  releases to address CVE-2026-28684, CVE-2026-25645, CVE-2025-58751, and
  CVE-2025-58752.
- Added PyPI Package URLs and PEP 639 SPDX license expressions to Python SBOM
  components so scanners cannot confuse ecosystems or miss modern license
  metadata.
- Upgraded to React Router 8.3.0, the patched release for
  GHSA-qwww-vcr4-c8h2, and removed the temporary SPA-only audit exception.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-09

  `agentscope-ai/QwenPaw-Data` GitHub organization.
